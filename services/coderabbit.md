## MOONGIFT Eye

CodeRabbit streamlines the code review process using AI technology. Particularly for large development teams and complex projects, it can help discover issues that human reviewers might miss and contribute to improving code quality.

Code review workload is a common challenge for development teams. While using CodeRabbit doesn't completely eliminate the need for code reviews, it ensures a minimum level of quality. After that, human reviewers can focus on logic and company-specific guidelines.
