## MOONGIFT Eye

Autify is a platform that solves the major challenge of "balancing quality and speed" in software development through AI-powered test automation. The ability to automate testing without coding is particularly beneficial, as it allows not only engineers but also QA and non-engineering team members to participate in the quality assurance process.

The automatic generation of test cases and scenarios using generative AI has the potential to contribute to both reducing test design workload and improving quality. Additionally, the provision of expert support services helps lower the barrier to implementing test automation.

In today's fast-paced software development environment, test automation platforms like Autify are becoming essential tools for improving development speed without compromising quality.
