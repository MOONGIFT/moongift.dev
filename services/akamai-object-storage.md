## MOONGIFT Eye

Akamai Object Storage was originally a service provided by Linode. Linode is known for its affordable VPS offerings, and their object storage service was also competitively priced. While the minimum cost is $5, it includes outbound transfer, making it quite cost-effective for sufficient capacity.

This service would be particularly convenient for users of other Akamai services or those using Linode servers.
