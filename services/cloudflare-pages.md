## Features

Cloudflare Pages allows you to deploy content via command line or integrate with repositories like GitHub for content updates. What sets it apart from other services is that while being a CDN, content updates are reflected immediately.

When integrating with a repository, you can choose to deploy to the main site or keep it on a unique URL by specifying a branch. This enables team members to review sites that are still under development.

While Cloudflare Pages supports Next.js applications, note that some implementation adjustments are needed compared to Vercel's setup.

## Usage

This site, MOONGIFT.dev, is also deployed on Cloudflare Pages. Although our site uses Docusaurus built with Node.js, it can be deployed without issues using the following command. The `build` folder contains the static files generated by Docusaurus.

```bash
npm run build && wrangler pages deploy build
```

Deployment is done using [Wrangler (command line)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/). You can set up CI/CD by running this command in GitHub Actions or similar services.

## MOONGIFT Eye

This site is built with Cloudflare Pages. Since it is Docusaurus, it is static hosting only, but if you want dynamic functionality, you can combine it with [Cloudflare Workers](https://moongift.dev/services/cloudflare-workers/).

The appeal of Cloudflare Pages is its unbeatable low price and excellent development experience through the CLI. Including custom domains, developers will be able to use it right away.
