## Features

The key features of Sakura Cloud Object Storage are as follows:

- S3-compatible API
- Free data transfer between Sakura Internet services

## Pricing

## MOONGIFT Eye

The object storage service offers free data transfer not only between Sakura Cloud services but also from shared hosting and VPS services.

However, it's important to note that the minimum charge of 495 yen applies even if you store just one file, making it relatively expensive for storing very small amounts of data.
