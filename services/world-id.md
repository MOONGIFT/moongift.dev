World ID is a decentralized ID provider provided by [World](https://world.org/). It supports OpenID Connect and provides a secure and anonymous way to prove "humanity" in the AI era.

World ID utilizes a technology called Face Auth. It registers iris information using a scanning device called Orb. The registered information can be used for external authentication through the World app.

The data is stored locally on the smartphone, ensuring privacy-conscious handling.

## MOONGIFT Eye

World ID is gaining attention partly because of Sam Altman's involvement with OpenAI. However, considering the current era of AI where fake news and AI-generated media are rampant, and automated attacks are occurring on social media, the movement to guarantee "humanity" is quite interesting.

From our experience with Orb registration, it was somewhat cumbersome (app operation and iris information registration). It seems challenging to achieve widespread adoption. We hope for improvements in UX, especially since Orb devices are still not widely available.
