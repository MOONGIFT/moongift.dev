## MOONGIFT Eye

While MinIO is open-source software, it primarily provides the UI interface. You'll need some form of storage (typically local) to use it. In this sense, it's more suitable for use with on-premises assets rather than cloud servers.

Alternatively, it could be interesting to use it as an interface for personal NAS systems.
