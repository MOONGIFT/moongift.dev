## MOONGIFT Eye

Firecrawl addresses a critical need in the AI development ecosystem by enabling the conversion of websites into structured data. For AI applications that use web content as training data, tools like Firecrawl are essential.

With its focus on generating LLM-ready data, Firecrawl is particularly valuable for RAG applications where the quality of input data directly impacts AI output quality.

While full self-hosting appears challenging at present, we look forward to its future development as an open-source project.
