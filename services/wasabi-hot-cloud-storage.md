## MOONGIFT Eye

Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage's main selling point is its lower operational costs compared to Amazon S3. This advantage becomes particularly significant when dealing with large storage volumes.

Therefore, it seems more suitable for storing large volumes of data such as confidential company data or backups, rather than for web services that gradually grow in size over time.
