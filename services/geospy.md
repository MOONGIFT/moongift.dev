## Features

The features of GeoSpy are as follows:

- Identify the location of a photo
- In addition to location information, identify the location with AI

GeoSpy identifies the location of a photo based on the background of the photo. If buildings or other objects can be identified, it provides a very accurate location.

## API

Using the GeoSpy API, you can specify the URL of an image to get location information and address.

[GeoSpy API \- AI Powered Intel](https://api.geospy.ai/)

The sample code is as follows:

```python
import requests
import base64

image_path = "YOUR_IMAGE_PATH_HERE"
with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

url = f"https://dev.geospy.ai/predict?image={encoded_string}&top_k=5"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

## MOONGIFT Eye

The atmosphere is like that of AI version of GeoGuessr. It accurately identifies the location of a photo based on the photo. The clues are the soil, vegetation, objects, and environmental information. Therefore, GeoSpy is said to be more accurate for outdoor photos.
