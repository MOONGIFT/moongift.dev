## MOONGIFT Eye

The characteristic of Simple Icons is that it features many service brand icons rather than general icons. With a large collection of IT service-related icons, it's convenient for displaying in websites and applications.

As an open-source project, it accepts icon registrations. Registering your company's service icon could help increase service recognition.
