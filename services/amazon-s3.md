## MOONGIFT Eye

Amazon S3 is the de facto standard for object storage. It integrates easily with various AWS services. While there are many compatible services, some may have different interfaces that prevent the use of SDKs.

Additionally, beyond simple data uploads, security conditions may differ from S3, so caution is required. When choosing an alternative service, it's important to verify that it meets your requirements. In this sense, using the de facto standard service offers advantages.
